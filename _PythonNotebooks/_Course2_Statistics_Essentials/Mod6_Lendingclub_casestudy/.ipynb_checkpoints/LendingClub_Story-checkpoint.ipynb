    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "**You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:**\n",
    "- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company\n",
    "- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "  **When a person applies for a loan, there are two types of decisions that could be taken by the company:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loan accepted: If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Fully paid: Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Current: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. the tenure of the loan is not yet completed. These candidates are not labelled as 'defaulted'.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Charged-off: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan \n",
    "\n",
    "- Loan rejected: The company had rejected the loan (because the candidate does not meet their requirements etc.). Since the loan was rejected, there is no transactional history of those applicants with the company and so this data is not available with the company (and thus in this dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Objectives\n",
    "  **This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.**\n",
    "- The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. "

    "\n",
    "**The history of borrowers between 2007 and 2011 provided will be used to do statistical analysis and provide insights on what parameters of the borrower are related to defaulting. This will help Lending Club avoid lending money to these customers or reduce the loan amount or increase the interest rate.**"
