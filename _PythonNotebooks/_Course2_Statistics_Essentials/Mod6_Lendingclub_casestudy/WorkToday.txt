About Lending Club:
Largest personal finance company - 3 Major loans - personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. 
Online interface - Lower interest rates.
Largest source of financial loss is due to lending to risky applicants - Due to charged off customers.

Objective:
GOAL AS MENTIONED IN THE ASSIGNMENT -  Identification of risky applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.
Based on analysis can we come up with a function that says, reject or approve loan? OPTIONAL

How to do?
1) The consumer finance company is 'Lending Club in SFO, CA'
Based on data given, identify patterns and recommend what should Lending Club do when a customer with a set of parameters apply for loan. 
a) Reject loan - What reasons? What compells to reject? Can't we reduce the loan amount or increase the interest rate or reduce the tenure? Are these possible?
b) Approve - If approve, what should be the loan approved amount? Tenure of loan, interest rate approved. Are these possible?

What to extract:
1) Is the customer good - Paying EMIs in time, past due, how many times, how many loans defaulted, any other black marks?
2) Is the customer risky - Paid EMIs in time, once a while delayed, closed all loans in time, no other black marks
3) Is customer good - Closed all loans in time. Good finances, no black marks.
4) What are loan attributes and consumer attributes that influence default?
5) Where is loan accepted column? 
	a) Fully paid (Principal and Interest).
	b) Current (Currently paying EMIs) - NOT defaulted.
	c) Charged-off - Not paid EMIs for a a long time and he has defaulted.
