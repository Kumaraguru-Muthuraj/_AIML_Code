How well those variables describe the price of a house?
These are the variables that were arrived after applying RFE in Linear Regression, Ridge and Lasso Regularizations.
The R2 values for the 3 algorithms are listed above. Notice that these are pretty close ~5%, except for Linear Regression. LR accuracy was low
due to the variance and we had to reduce it with regularization. The Regularization algorithms have given reasonable accuracies in test data.
The residual analysis for the 3 algorithms indicate homoscedasticity, no patterns in errors, errors are normally distributed around 0.

Lambda for Ridge and Lasso - The lambdas for Ridge and Lasso are 1.5 and 0.0001 respectively.
