We observe that most of the indicators are from the 8th month where some activity of the customer indicates churn in the upcoming month. 

All the coefficients, except roam_og_mou_8 and max_rech_data_8, are negative indicating that a decrease in the values of these features indicate that there is a correlation to churn. Increase in roam_og_mou_8 and max_rech_data_8 also indicate a correlation to churn.

An increase in the following 2 feature values indicate that the expenditure of the customer is high and hence some kind od discount / package can be provided around these.
roam_og_mou_8 - Roaming outgoing minutes of usage in 8th month.
max_rech_data_8 - Maximum recharge data in 8th month.
