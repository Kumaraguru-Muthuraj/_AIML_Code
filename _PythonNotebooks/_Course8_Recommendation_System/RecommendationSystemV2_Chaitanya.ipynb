    "Adjusted cosine similarity is a modified version of vector-based similarity where we incorporate the fact that different users have different ratings schemes. In other words, some users might rate items highly in general, and others might give items lower ratings as a preference. To handle this nature from rating given by user , we subtract average ratings for each user from each user's rating for different movies."
